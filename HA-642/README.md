Hello Sabiha Salma, 
I Hope you are having a wonderful day. 

Coming to the website, As the instructions from the profssors I created 3 html pages. They are 
classWebsite.html that show cases myself and my previous works, The second one is the cs_department_info_page.html page where I display a short info on CS Department and the various degrees in the CS Department and the mandatory courses of each course that should be completed to meet the requirements of getting a degree, The third is the student_survey_form.html where we collect the student basic info like name, email, address, date, etc.... Now I will explain everything I did in each website.

classWebsite.html
In this html page we took the template from the w3schools https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp and edited the required components in the page.In the navbar I had two more components added in the given template which redirect to the cs_department_info_page.html. The other component is the student_survey_form.html.I also added some cool icons to both of the components to make it look nice.As instructed from the professor I added my profile picture to the web page using the .image tag and then described about myself using the .paragraph tag.
